The picture is related to our topic, as it is taken after the peace declaration. It is a soviet armored car (which I believe is an FAI-M, looking at the shape of the hull and the turret) that was captured by Finnish forces, somewhere around the time that the peace was declared.​ ​ The focus of the picture is obviously the armored car, and the Finnish soldier sitting in the car. He seems happy, most likely because the war has ended, and because he found an armored car, which could help the Finnish army in the future. ​ The vehicle seems to be stuck, which means that the soldier can not drive it yet. It also kind of looks like the soldier is trying to free the front wheels, as it seems he has his hands on the steering wheel​ ​ The man in the picture is likely relieved of the war ending, as it is known that Finns had to go through very tough times during the winter war. This is why he is smiling, and having fun inside the armored car, now that there is no more threat of the Soviets attacking.​ ​ I think that the picture was taken to record the captured vehicles that the Finnish army were able to get after the war had ended. For me, at least this is the most likely reason for the image, as there are tons of other pictures of Finnish captured vehicles from the winter war, and after. I do not believe that the picture is biased, as it is just a simple picture of a man smiling. ​ ​ Most likely the armored car was taken somewhere where it could be fixed, and then later be used. Another possibility is that it was in such a bad condition, that it was put into a museum, or scrapped for metal. If it was used, though, during for example the continuation war, it might have saved someone's life, who was inside it, whilst being fired at.​ ​ In warfare, even today, armored cars are still used to some capacity. Warfare has largely evolved though, as nowadays armored cars are called “armored personnel carriers” and have a largely different use than back in ww2, as during the Winter war, armored cars were used to scout areas that were likely to have enemy forces. Nowadays, though they are used to get soldiers from one place to another in a dangerous area. For example, during the Russo Ukrainian conflict, they have proved to be an invaluable asset. Therefore, capturing an armored car would be a largely different thing back in ww2, as they had a different use. We can also see that there is a horse in the background, which the soldier probably used to get there. This is because Finland didn’t have that many cars or other forms of transport at the time but had an abundance of horses. Obviously, today, horses are not used, and if there is a shortage of military vehicles, soldiers’ personal cars are often used. On the other hand, a similarity that I find, is that in todays warfare, vehicles are still captured, and it is much preferred, to take the vehicles for yourself, than it is to destroy them. ​ As a Finnish person, I would obviously see the picture as a win for the Finnish people, but in other countries the picture might be interpreted differently, since for example Russians are probably not very happy to see a Finnish guy sitting in their old, captured armored car. Therefore, a Russian person might interpret the picture as the enemy capturing a friendly asset, and a Finnish person interpret it as a friendly soldier capturing an enemy car. This is why during my interpretation I have tried to stay as neutral as possible. ​
